        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> Kitfo Beef Tartare is a common dish usually found on an Ethiopian
            sharing platter. It is raw high-quality beef that’s finely minced
            and seasoned with spices and clarified butter. The taste is savory
            and salty; perfect umami with a wonderfully soft melt-in-your-mouth
            texture.</p>
        
        <ul> <h3> Ingredients </h3>
            <li> <em> Beef filet</em> – well-trimmed </li>
            <li> <em> Anchovy paste</em> – for a unique salty and savory flavor </li>
            <li> <em>Seasonings</em> – cayenne pepper, salt, garlic powder, ground cardamom</li>
            <li> <em> Clarified butter</em> – or ghee </li>
        </ul>
        <ol> <h3> Steps </h3>
            <li> Set out a large high-powered food processor. 
                <strong> Make sure </strong> to trim all the silver skin and fat
                off the fillet and cut the fillet into large 
                chunks. Place in the food processor.</li>
            <li> Add the cayenne, salt, anchovy paste, 
                garlic powder, and cardamom. Pulse to chop
                the fillet into fine chunks. You can choose
                to stop when the beef resembles ¼ inch chunks,
                or chop smaller into ground steak.</li>
            <li> Once the texture is to your liking, melt the
                clarified butter and pour over the top. Mix the
                butter in by hand, do not pulse. </li>
            <li> Serve the freshly prepared steak tartare
                room temperature, or seal in a container and
                refrigerate for 30 minutes (or more) to enjoy 
                cold.</li>
        </ol>

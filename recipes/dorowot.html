    <h1> Dorowot Recipe </h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> Doro Wat is one of the most famous of all African dishes.  
        You will find it in every Ethiopian restaurant and virtually
        anyone who is familiar with African cuisine will have heard
        of it.  Another version, though not as commonly known here,
        is Sega Wat, made with beef (fyi, you’ll find recipes online
        calling it Sik Sik Wat, but I’ve confirmed with the chefs of 
        several Ethiopian restaurants that it’s Sega Wat).  
        You can directly substitute beef for chicken and follow
         the same cooking instructions.</p>
    
    <ul> <h3> Ingredients </h3>
        <li> <em> Beef filet</em> – well-trimmed </li>
        <li> <em> Anchovy paste</em> – for a unique salty and savory flavor </li>
        <li> <em>Seasonings</em> – cayenne pepper, salt, garlic powder, ground cardamom</li>
        <li> <em> Clarified butter</em> – or ghee </li>
    </ul>
    <ol> <h3> Steps </h3>
        <li> Set out a large high-powered food processor. 
            <strong> Make sure </strong> to trim all the silver skin and fat
            off the fillet and cut the fillet into large 
            chunks. Place in the food processor.</li>
        <li> Add the cayenne, salt, anchovy paste, 
            garlic powder, and cardamom. Pulse to chop
            the fillet into fine chunks. You can choose
            to stop when the beef resembles ¼ inch chunks,
            or chop smaller into ground steak.</li>
        <li> Once the texture is to your liking, melt the
            clarified butter and pour over the top. Mix the
            butter in by hand, do not pulse. </li>
        <li> Serve the freshly prepared steak tartare
            room temperature, or seal in a container and
            refrigerate for 30 minutes (or more) to enjoy 
            cold.</li>
    </ol>
